# Self-Supervised Learning for Audio Inference
This repository contains the codebase for all experiments for the research project `Self-Supervised Learning for Audio Inference`. <br />

This is an extension work for ABT, focusing on exploring augmentation methods suitable for audio self-supervised representation learning.

Currently organizing and preparing the code repository
